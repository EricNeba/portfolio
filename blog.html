					<h1>Eric & Career Change</h1>
					<h5>January, 2019</h5>
					<p>After loosing my job as a social worker and being someone who had always like flexibility and working independently, I began to think of a change in careers. Working as a social worker meant you will always be at the mercy of funders who often fund programs for a couple of years and the end of the funding in 70% of the situations meant umemployment. Second, the sector is not as brought, challenging and innovative as IT. For these reasons I started to do some research and talked to a few people, searched the job market and realized that there were many options of interest to me so I decided to engage on this jorney.</p>
