					<h1>Eric's Blog</h1>
					<p> Hello!My name is Eric Neba. I am currently a student at Comprehensive IT Institute taking a course on frontend development. This Blog is to keep updates on my journey in this field and techlogies I learn along.</p>
					<p>I would equally like to document my professional journey as a get along not leaving out daily issues that I wouldn't want them to pass by.</p>
					<p>Given the fact that I love news, I would equally put interesting news items which i think are inportant for my followers. I love traveling; I would share my destination experiences, photos and videos</p>
					<p>I have lots of interests (photography, cultures,new technology etc) and I will be sharing these on my blog</p>
					<h3>Lets Enjoy the Journey Together!!!</h3>
